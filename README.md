# PhpStorm autocompletion for Bolt

Configuring Contenttypes, Taxonomies, Fields, Relationships and Menus ( mentioned as definitions in 
the document ) is something you will do quite often when building sites using Bolt. With these 
Phpstorm Live Templates you can reduce the effort and time you spend configuring these Bolt definitions.

## How to install
1) Download the `settings.zip` from this repository
2) Open up PhpStorm
3) In the top menu go to `File > Import Settings`
4) Select the downloaded `settings.zip` file or directory where the file is located.

## How to use 
The autocompletion can be triggered by typing in the letter `b` in a `.yaml` file.

For a more specific autocompletion, for instance Bolt Fields, type in `bf` (`b` refers to Bolt and `f` 
refers to Fields). A list of suggestions with the different types of Fields will be displayed.

The list of suggestions can be navigated using the up/down keyboard arrows.

To select a suggestion from the list you can directly double click on it or press `Enter` or `Tab` to
select the suggestion that is focused.

Use the `Tab` key to move the focus into the next line through the structure options. 

**ðŸ’¡Tips**: Tab through the structure filling in the inline options first. For Contenttypes skip `fields`
and `relations` and add them in a second step. 

### Autocompletion variants
